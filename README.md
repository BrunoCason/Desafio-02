# Project Description
**Plant Peace** is a project for developing a website for a fictional plant store, built using React. Our main goal is to faithfully recreate the original design of the mentioned pages, following the model established in Figma, providing an intuitive and pleasant user experience. Additionally, the project includes a range of advanced features, such as user authentication, plant data management, dynamic product display, among others.

# Project Features

- `User Authentication`: Uses the Clerk library to ensure that only authorized users can access the website.
- `Plant Registration Form`: Allows users to add new plants to the store's catalog through an accessible form.
- `Plant Display on the Homepage`: Displays plants on the homepage using carousels, offering an attractive visual experience to users.
- `Database Simulation`: Uses JSON Server to dynamically store and access plant data, simulating a database for the project.
- `Discounts and Promotions`: Highlights plants on sale in the "Plants in Sale" section, calculating the discount based on the data from JSON Server and displaying the final price.
- `Plant Details`: Provides detailed view of plants when clicked, redirecting to a specific page with detailed information.
- `Form Validation`: Ensures the accuracy of the data when registering a plant through the validation of all form fields.
- `Responsiveness`: Offers a consistent and enjoyable user experience across devices with different screen sizes.
